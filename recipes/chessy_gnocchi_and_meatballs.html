         </p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>   
<ul>
   <li> 1 red capsicum</li>
   <li> 1 red onion</li>
   <li> 3 fresh chorizo sausages</li>
   <li> 400g jar red wine and garlic pastsa sauce</li>
   <li> 500g packet of fresh gnocchi</li>
   <li> Fresh continental parsley leaves</li>
   </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the kettle and heat a deep ovenproof frying pan over medium-high heat. Preheat grill on high.</li>
        <li>While pan and water heat up, deseed capsicum. Slice the capsicum and onion.</li>
        <li>Add oil to pan. Slit end of sausages and squeeze small portions of mince from casing into pan. Cook, tossing, for 1 minute or until starts to brown. Add capsicum and onion. Cook, tossing, for 2 minutes or until onion starts to soften. Add sauce. Stir until combined.</li>
        <li>While the meatballs are cooking, pour the boiling water into a large saucepan over high heat. (Donâ€™t fill too high as it will take too long to boil again.) Add the gnocchi and cook until the gnocchi rises to the surface. Drain.</li>
        <Li>Add gnocchi to frying pan. Toss until well combined. Sprinkle over cheese. Grill for 1-2 minutes or until melted. Top with parsley.</Li>
